Set up your WordPress Database

Run mysql in the terminal window:

sudo mysql -uroot -p

Enter the root password you created when you set up the database.

You will see the message Welcome to the MariaDB monitor and then the MariaDB [(none)]> prompt.


At the MariaDB [(none)]> prompt, type:
Tip: Donâ€™t forget to type the semicolon at the end.

create database wordpress;
If this has been successful, you should see Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec).


At the MariaDB prompt, grant database privileges to the root user. Change YOURPASSWORD to the password you created before.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURPASSWORD';

For the changes to take effect, you will need to flush the database privileges:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Exit the MariaDB prompt with Ctrl + D.
