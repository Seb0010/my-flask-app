1. Install MariaDB
MariaDB is a popular database engine. Like PHP, it’s widely used on web servers, which is why projects like WordPress use it, and why those projects are so popular.


Type this command to install the MariaDB Server and PHP-MySQL packages:

sudo apt install mariadb-server php-mysql -y

After that, restart Apache:

sudo service apache2 restart



2. Set up

Run the MySQL secure installation command in the terminal window.

sudo mysql_secure_installation

Go through the setup wizard using the following answers:

Enter current password for root (enter for none): — press Enter.

Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] - Type in N and press Enter

Change the root password? - Type in Y and press Enter

New password: - Type in a password and press Enter, then repeat a second time. Important: remember this root password, as you will need it later to set up WordPress.

Remove anonymous users - Type in Y

Disallow root login remotely - Type in Y

Remove test database and access to it - Type in Y

Reload privilege tables now - Type in Y
