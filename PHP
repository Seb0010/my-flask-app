1. Install PHP
PHP is a preprocessor: itâ€™s code that runs when the server receives a request for a web page via a web browser. It works out what needs to be shown on the page, and then sends that page to the browser.


Type the following command in the terminal to install PHP:

" sudo apt install php -y "


2. Test PHP

Type this command to delete the index.html file from earlier:

sudo rm index.html

Create a new file called index.php:

sudo thonny index.php

In the Thonny code editor, type this PHP code into the file and save it.

<?php echo "hello world"; ?>
