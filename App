Create the app

Open a terminal and use the mkdir command to create a new directory inside your documents folder called webapp.

mkdir ~/Documents/webapp

Use the ‘change directory’ command cd to open the new directory.

cd ~/Documents/webapp

From the Programming menu, open Thonny.


Add this Python code into the blank file.

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello world'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')

Save the new file with the name app.py inside the webapp folder you just created.


Go back to your terminal window and run the script you just wrote:

python3 app.py

From your Raspberry Pi’s menu, open Internet > Chromium web browser


In the address bar, type localhost:5000 and press Enter. You should see the welcome page.
