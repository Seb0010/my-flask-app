1.  Set up an Apache web server

Install Apache

Open a terminal window by selecting Accessories > Terminal from the menu.


Type the following command into the terminal and press Enter to install apache2

" sudo apt install apache2 -y "



2. Test the web server

By default, Apache puts a test HTML file in the web folder that you will be able to view from your Pi or another computer on your network.


Open Chromium by selecting Internet > Chromium Web Browser from the menu.


Type localhost in the address bar.
(You should see the Apache2 Debian Default Page)



3. Changing the default web page
This default web page is just a HTML file on the file system. It is located at /var/www/html/index.html.


Type the following command in the terminal to change to the directory containing the HTML file:

cd /var/www/html

Open the index.html file using Thonny

sudo thonny index.html

Delete the contents of the file, then type a short message and save your changes.


Go back to Chromium and refresh the browser. You will see your message appear on the web page.
